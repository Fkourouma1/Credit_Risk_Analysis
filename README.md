# Credit_Risk_Analysis
In our machine learning project, we used the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, we oversampled the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersampled the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Next, we combined approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. We then compared two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. We finally evaluated the performance of these models and made a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
