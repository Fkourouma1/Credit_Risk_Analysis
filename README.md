# Credit_Risk_Analysis
# Overview 
In our machine learning project, we used the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, we oversampled the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersampled the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Next, we combined approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. We then compared two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. We finally evaluated the performance of these models and made a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
To complete our steps, we followed four deliverables:
## Results
### Deliverable 1
- we calculated an accuracy score for the model
- we generated confusion matrix
- We also generated an imbalanced classification report
### Deliverable 2 
- An accuracy score for the model is calculated (5 pt)
- A confusion matrix has been generated (5 pt)
- An imbalanced classification report has been generated (5 pt)
### Deliverable 3
- The BalancedRandomForestClassifier algorithm does the following:
- An accuracy score for the model is calculated (2.5 pt)
A confusion matrix has been generated (2.5 pt)
An imbalanced classification report has been generated (5 pt)
The features are sorted in descending order by feature importance (5 pt)
The EasyEnsembleClassifier algorithm does the following:
An accuracy score of the model is calculated (2.5 pt)
A confusion matrix has been generated (2.5 pt)
An imbalanced classification report has been generated (5 pt)
